    <description>An example of an initializer that will draw this complaint is as follows. int s[] = { { 1 } }; After the compiler has seen the first curly it is expecting to see a number (or other numeric expression). Compilers that strictly adhere to the ISO C and C++ Standards will flag this as ill-formed code.
    Note that it is legal (but somewhat arcane) to employ a left curly at the top-level when initializing an object of scalar type. For example, the following is well-formed: int i = { 0 }; // OK; initialize scalar i with 0. char *t = { "bar" }; // OK; initialize scalar t with a pointer to // a statically allocated array.

The primary intention of this message is to alert the user to the non-standard nature of this construct. The typical response is to suppress the message and go on. But a few caveats are in order.
    Programmers who intend to work only with C code with the GNU extensions may safely disable this diagnostic but C++ users should think twice. This is partly for the reasons given in GCC's documentation (see the section entitled "Statements and Declarations in Expressions") and partly because the meaning of '( {' will change in G++ when its maintainers implement Initializer Lists (a new core language feature that is expected to appear in the 2010 version of the ISO C++ Standard).</description>

    <description>This message is issued when a header is #include'd that had previously been designated as bypass and it has been determined that this header follows a different header include sequence than in some other module. The name of the other module is given by the second parameter of this message. In order not to bury the programmer under a ton of header names, we have made an effort to determine the precise point where the two modules went their separate ways. The first include file difference occurred when that other module included the header identified by File1, whereas the current module was attempting to include the header identified by File2. Each Filei is a pair of parameters of the form 'String' (Location) where the location is the point of the #include.
    For example: Module x.cpp: #include "alpha.h" #include "delta.h" #include "beta.h" #include "gamma.h"
    Module y.cpp: #include "alpha.h" #include "beta.h" #include "gamma.h" When the include of "beta.h" occurs in module y.cpp (and if beta.h has been designated as bypass), there will be a Fatal Error 328 that the header sequence of module 'x.cpp' differs from the current module in that the former module included 'delta.h' at a point where the current module included 'beta.h'.
    It was necessary to make this message a fatal error since attempting to bypass headers that do not follow a consistent header sequence is an act of folly. It is possible to continue on after the 328 in hopes of picking up more inconsistencies in other modules. This can be done using the +fce (Continue-on-Error) flag.</description>

The message contains the name of the function (Symbol), the questionable value (Integer) and the argument number (Context). The function may be a standard library function designed to accept only positive values such as malloc or memcpy (third argument), or may have been identified by the user as such through the -function or -sem options.
    The negative integral value may in fact be unsigned. Thus: void *malloc( unsigned ); void f() { int n = -1; int *p; p = malloc(n); // Warning 422 p = malloc( (unsigned) n ); // Warning 422 }
    will result in the warnings indicated. Note that casting the expression does not inhibit the warning.
    There is a slight difference in behavior on 32-bit systems versus 16-bit systems. If long is the same size as int (as in 32-bit systems) the warning is issued based upon the sign bit. If long is larger than an int (as is true on typical 16-bit systems) the warning is issued if the value was a converted negative as in the examples above. It is not issued if an unsigned int has the high-order bit set. This is because it is not unreasonable to malloc more that 32,176 bytes in a 16-bit system.</description>

    <description>A pointer of auto storage class was allocated storage which was neither freed nor returned to the caller. This represents a "memory leak". A pointer is considered custodial if it uniquely points to the storage area. It is not considered custodial if it has been copied. Thus: int *p = new int[20]; // p is a custodial pointer int *q = p; // p is no longer custodial p = new int[20]; // p again becomes custodial q = p + 0; // p remains custodial
    Here p does not lose its custodial property by merely participating in an arithmetic operation.
    A pointer can lose its custodial property by passing the pointer to a function. If the parameter of the function is typed pointer to const or if the function is a library function, that assumption is not made. For example p = malloc(10); strcpy (p, "hello");
    Then p still has custody of storage allocated.
    It is possible to indicate via semantic options that a function will take custody of a pointer.</description>

    <name>L0453: Function 'Symbol', previously designated pure, String 'Name'</name>
    <description>A semantic option designated that the named function, Symbol, is pure (lacking non-local side-effects; see the pure semantic in Section 4. Semantics ). However, an impurity was detected. Such impurities include calling a function through a function pointer, accessing a volatile variable, modifying a static variable or calling a function whose purity PC-lint/FlexeLint cannot verify. String describes which of these reasons apply and Name shows the related variable or function, as appropriate.
    Despite the inconsistency reported, the function will continue to be regarded as pure.</description>

    <description>A call to an unlock() function was made that was not preceded by a balancing lock(). It is assumed that every mutex lock() function must be balanced by exactly one unlock() function, no more, no less.

    <name>L0456: Two execution paths are being combined with different mutex lock states</name>
    <description>It is the purpose of this message to make absolutely certain that every lock has a corresponding unlock in the same unbroken sequence of code in the same function.
    Execution paths can be combined at the end of an if statement, switch statement, or the beginning of while, for and do statements, a label (target of goto), etc. In all these cases we check to make sure that the mutex lock states are the same. For example: //lint -sem( lock, thread_lock ) void f( bool x ) { if( x ) lock(); // Warning 456 issued here ... It could be argued that if an unlock() call would appear under control of the very same bool x in the example above then all would be well. And if this is your coding style you are free to turn this message off. But errors in mutex locking have such horrible programming consequences as to suggest especially strong measures to assure code correctness. We recommend, for example: //lint -sem( lock, thread_lock ) //lint -sem( unlock, thread_unlock ) void f( bool x ) { if( x ) { lock(); /* something */; unlock(); } else { /* something */ } } If the 'something' that is being executed is sufficiently complex, then it can be made into a function.</description>

    <description>This message is activated only when it appears that the program has more than one thread. See Section 8. Multi-thread Support to determine what those conditions might be.
    If a function's address is taken, we presume that we are unable to determine statically all the locations from which the function may be called and so we presume that any and all threads can call this function and so the function needs to have protected access to every static variable that it might touch.
    There are several remedies to such a message. If multiple threads can indeed access this function, then place a mutex lock in the function. If there already is a mutex lock and we don't recognize it, then set the thread_protected semantic for the function. If only one thread really accesses this function or if the access is guaranteed to be benign, then, after making sure this condition is commented in the code, use the same thread_protected semantic for the function.</description>

    <description>An attempt was made to take the address of an array name. At one time such an expression was officially illegal (K&amp;R C [1]), was not consistently implemented, and was, therefore, suspect. However, the expression is legal in ANSI C and designates a pointer to an array. For example, given
    int a[10]; int (*p) [10];
    Then a and &amp;a, as pointers, both represent the same bit pattern, but whereas a is a pointer to int, &amp;a is a pointer to array 10 of int. Of the two only &amp;a may be assigned to p without complaint. If you are using the &amp; operator in this way, we recommend that you disable this message.</description>

    where ch is declared as char and char is signed. Although the cast may appear to prevent sign extension of ch, it does not. Following the normal promotion rules of C, ch is first converted to int which extends the sign and only then is the quantity cast to unsigned. To suppress sign extension you may use:
    (unsigned char) ch
    Otherwise, if sign extension is what you want and you just want to suppress the warning in this instance you may use:
    (unsigned) (int) ch
    Although these examples have been given in terms of casting a char they will also be given whenever this cast is made upon a signed quantity whose size is less than the casted type. Examples include signed bit fields (a possibility in the new standard), expressions involving char, and expressions involving short when this type is smaller than int or a direct cast of an int to an unsigned long (if int's is smaller than long).

    will, if n is -2 and u is 2, not assign -1 to n but will assign some very large value.

    where u is unsigned and n is signed will elicit this message whereas:
    if( u &gt; 12 ) ...
    will not (even though 12 is officially an int it is obvious that it is not negative). It is not a good idea to mix unsigned quantities with signed quantities in any case (a 737 will also be issued) but, with the four relationals, a negative value can produce obscure results. For example, if the conditional:
    if( n &lt; 0 ) ...
    is true then the similar appearing:
    u = 0; if( n &lt; u ) ...
    is false because the promotion to unsigned makes n very large.

It is true that if you shift 5 left by 29 bits (or 31 bits) you will have in many cases (probably most cases) a negative number but this is not guaranteed. According to the C Standard [4], shifting a positive signed integer (5 in this case) left by a number of places (n in this case) is only valid if the type can accommodate 5*(2**n). This is equivalent to not shifting a one into or through the sign bit.
    As another example: int n; ... if( (n &gt;&gt; 5) &gt;= 0 ) ... would always be regarded as true. This is because shifting a negative number to the right yields results that are implementation defined.

    <name>L0591: Variable 'Symbol' depends on the order of evaluation; it is used/modified through function 'Symbol' via calls: String"</name>
    <description>The indicated variable (given by the first Symbol) was involved in an expression that contained a call of a function (given by the second Symbol) that would use or modify the variable. Further, the order of evaluation of the two is not determinable. For example: extern int n; void f() { n++; } int g() { f(); return 1; } int h() { return n + g(); } // Warning 591 The above code, on the second pass, will elicit the following warning: Warning 591: Variable 'n' depends on the order of evaluation; it is modified through function 'g(void)' via calls: g() =&gt; f() If the function g() is called and then n is added, you will obtain a different result than if n were first evaluated and then the call made.
    The programmer should generally rewrite these expressions so that the compiler is constrained to use the intended order. For example if the programmer wanted to use the n prior to the call on g() it can alter h() to the following: int h() { int k = n; return k + g(); } This analysis requires two passes; the first pass builds the necessary call trees.</description>

    <name>L0592: Non-literal format specifier used without arguments</name>
    <description>A printf/scanf style function received a non-literal format specifier without trailing arguments. For example: char msg[100]; ... printf( msg ); This can easily be rewritten to the relatively safe: char msg[100]; ... printf( "%s", msg ); The danger lies in the fact that msg can contain hidden format codes. If msg is read from user input, then in the first example, a naive user could cause a glitch or a crash and a malicious user might exploit this to undermine system security. Since the unsafe form can easily be transformed into the safe form the latter should always be used.</description>

    <description>This is the 'possible' version of message 429. A pointer of auto storage class was allocated storage and not all paths leading to a return statement or to the end of the function contained either a free or a return of the pointer. Hence there is a potential memory leak. For example: void f( int n ) { int *p = new int; if( n ) delete p; } // message 593 In this example an allocation is made and, if n is 0, no delete will have been made.

    <name>L0605: Increase in pointer capability (Context)</name>
    <description>This warning is typically caused by assigning a (pointer to const) to an ordinary pointer. For example: int *p; const int *q; p = q; /* 605 */ The message will be inhibited if a cast is used as in:
    p = (int *) q;
    An increase in capability is indicated because the const pointed to by q can now be modified through p. This message can be given for the volatile qualifier as well as the const qualifier and may be given for arbitrary pointer depths (pointers to pointers, pointers to arrays, etc.).
    If the number of pointer levels exceeds one, things get murky in a hurry. For example: const char ** ppc; char ** pp; pp = ppc; /* 605 - clearly not safe */ ppc = pp; /* 605 - looks safe but it's not */ It was not realized by the C community until very recently that assigning pp to ppc was dangerous. The problem is that after the above assignment, a pointer to a const char can be assigned indirectly through ppc and accessed through pp which can then modify the const char.
    The message speaks of an "increase in capability" in assigning to ppc, which seems counter intuitive because the indirect pointer has less capability. However, assigning the pointer does not destroy the old one and the combination of the two pointers represents a net increase in capability.
    The message may also be given for function pointer assignments when the prototype of one function contains a pointer of higher capability than a corresponding pointer in another prototype. There is a curious inversion here whereby a prototype of lower capability translates into a function of greater trust and hence greater capability (a Trojan Horse). For example, let
    void warrior( char * );
    be a function that destroys its argument. Consider the function:
    void Troy( void (*horse)(const char *) );
    Troy() will call horse() with an argument that it considers precious believing the horse() will do no harm. Before compilers knew better and believing that adding in a const to the destination never hurt anything, earlier compilers allowed the Greeks to pass warrior() to Troy and the rest, as they say, is history.</description>

    <name>L0647: Suspicious truncation</name>
    <description>This message is issued when it appears that there may have been an unintended loss of information during an operation involving int or unsigned int the result of which is later converted to long. It is issued only for systems in which int is smaller than long. For example:
    (long) (n &lt;&lt; 8)
    might elicit this message if n is unsigned int, whereas
    (long) n &lt;&lt; 8
    would not. In the first case, the shift is done at int precision and the high order 8 bits are lost even though there is a subsequent conversion to a type that might hold all the bits. In the second case, the shifted bits are retained.
    The operations that are scrutinized and reported upon by this message are: shift left, multiplication, and bit-wise complementation. Addition and subtraction are covered by Informational message 776.&lt;/description&gt;&lt;/rule&gt;
    The conversion to long may be done explicitly with a cast as shown or implicitly via assignment, return, argument passing or initialization.
    The message can be suppressed by casting. You may cast one of the operands so that the operation is done in full precision as is given by the second example above. Alternatively, if you decide there is really no problem here (for now or in the future), you may cast the result of the operation to some form of int. For example, you might write:
    (long) (unsigned) (n &lt;&lt; 8)
    In this way PC-lint/FlexeLint will know you are aware of and approve of the truncation.</description>

    <name>L0648: Overflow in computing constant for operation: String</name>
    <description>Arithmetic overflow was detected while computing a constant expression. For example, if int is 16 bits then 200 * 200 will result in an overflow. String gives the operation that caused the overflow and may be one of: addition, unsigned addition, multiplication, unsigned multiplication, negation, shift left, unsigned shift left, subtraction, or unsigned sub.
    To suppress this message for particular constant operations you may have to supply explicit truncation. For example, if you want to obtain the low order 8 bits of the integer 20000 into the high byte of a 16-bit int, shifting left would cause this warning. However, truncating first and then shifting would be OK. The following code illustrates this where int is 16 bits. 20000u &lt;&lt; 8; /* 648 */ (0xFF &amp; 20000u) &lt;&lt; 8; /* OK */ If you truncate with a cast you may make a signed expression out of an unsigned. For example, the following receives a warning (for 16 bit int).
    (unsigned char) OxFFFu &lt;&lt; 8 /* 648 */
    because the unsigned char is promoted to int before shifting. The resulting quantity is actually negative. You would need to revive the unsigned nature of the expression with
    (unsigned) (unsigned char) OxFFF &lt;&lt; 8 /* OK */</description>

    <description>In a comparison operator or equality test (or implied equality test as for a case statement), a constant operand is not in the range specified by the other operand. For example, if 300 is compared against a char variable, this warning will be issued. Moreover, if char is signed (and 8 bits) you will get this message if you compare against an integer greater than 127. The problem can be fixed with a cast. For example:
    if( ch == 0xFF ) ... if( (unsigned char) ch == 0xFF ) ...
    If char is signed (+fcu has not been set) the first receives a warning and can never succeed. The second suppresses the warning and corrects the bug.
    PC-lint/FlexeLint will take into account the limited precision of some operands such as bit-fields and enumerated types. Also, PC-lint/FlexeLint will take advantage of some computations that limit the precision of an operand. For example,
    if( (n &amp; 0xFF) &gt;&gt; 4 == 16 ) ...
    will receive this warning because the left-hand side is limited to 4 bits of precision.</description>

    <description>A comma operator appeared unbraced and unparenthesized in a statement following an if, else, while or for clause. For example: if( n &gt; 0 ) n = 1, n = 2; Thus the comma could be mistaken for a semi-colon and hence be the source of subtle bugs.

If this is what the programmer intended he can also render this as "\07" "9" so that there can be no misunderstanding.

    <name>L0694: The type of constant 'String' (precision Integer) is dialect dependent</name>
    <description>A decimal integer constant that requires all the bits of an unsigned long for its representation has a type that depends on the dialect of C or C++ implemented by the compiler you are using. For example, the constant 3000000000 requires 32 bits for its representation. If longs are 32 bits, then the constant is judged to be unsigned long in C90, long long in C99 and undefined in C++.
    You can remove the ambiguity by applying a clarifying suffix. If you intend this to be unsigned use the 'U' suffix. If you intend this to be a long long use the 'LL' suffix. If the latter and you are using C++ then turn on the +fll flag.</description>

    <description>In C99, the result of a call to a function declared with 'inline' but not 'static' or 'extern' is unspecified.
    Example: Let the following text represent two translation units: /* In module_1.c */ void f() {}
    /* In module_2.c */ inline void f() {} void g() { f(); } /* which f() is called? */ The C99 Standard dictates that the above call to f() from g() in module_2.c may result in the execution of either f().
    The programmer may avoid confusion and improve portability by using the keyword 'static' in addition to 'inline'. The keyword 'extern' can also be used along with the 'inline' to resolve this ambiguity; however, we recommend using 'static' because, as of this writing, more compilers correctly interpret 'static inline'.</description>

    <description>The named static variable (local to a function) was not explicitly initialized prior to use. The following remarks apply to messages 728 and 729 as well as 727. By no explicit initialization we mean that there was no initializer present in the definition of the object, no direct assignment to the object, and no address operator applied to the object or, if the address of the object was taken, it was assigned to a pointer to const. These messages do not necessarily signal errors since the implicit initialization for static variables is 0. However, the messages are helpful in indicating those variables that you had forgotten to initialize to a value. To extract the maximum benefit from the messages we suggest that you employ an explicit initializer for those variables that you want to initialize to 0. For example:
    static int n = 0;
    For variables that will be initialized dynamically, do not use an explicit initializer as in:

If you had no intention of mapping these characters into a single character you may precede the initial '?' with a backslash. If you are aware of the convention and you intend that the Trigraph be converted you should suppress this informational message.</description>

    <name>L0740: Unusual pointer cast (incompatible indirect types)</name>
    <description>A cast is being made to convert one pointer to another such that neither of the pointers is a generic pointer (neither is pointer to char, unsigned char, or void) and the indirect types are truly different. The message will not be given if the indirect types differ merely in signedness (e.g., pointer to unsigned versus pointer to int) or in qualification (e.g., pointer to const int versus pointer to int). The message will also not be given if one of the indirect types is a union.
    The main purpose of this message is to report possible problems for machines in which pointer to char is rendered differently from pointer to word. Consider casting a pointer to pointer to char to a pointer to pointer to word. The indirect bit pattern remains unchanged.
    A second reason is to identify those pointer casts in which the indirect type doesn't seem to have the proper bit pattern such as casting from a pointer to int to a pointer to double.
    If you are not interested in running on machines in which char pointers are fundamentally different from other pointers then you may want to suppress this message. You can also suppress this message by first casting to char pointer or to void pointer but this is only recommended if the underlying semantics are right.</description>

This can lead to better (and earlier) error detection. One way to suppress this message is by introducing a vacuous default: break; statement.

If you accompany the vacuous statement with a suitable comment, your code will at least be more readable.

    <name>L0789: Assigning address of auto variable 'Symbol' to static</name>
    <description>The address of an auto variable (Symbol) is being assigned to a static variable. This is dangerous because the static variable will persist after return from the function in which the auto is declared but the auto will be, in theory, gone. This can prove to be among the hardest bugs to find. If you have one of these, make certain there is no error and use -esym to suppress the message for a particular variable.</description>

    <description>From information gleaned from earlier statements it is conceivable that a null pointer (a pointer whose value is 0) can be used in a context where null pointers are inappropriate. In the case of binary operators one of the words 'left' or 'right' is used to designate which operand is null. Symbol identifies the pointer variable that may be NULL. This is similar to messages 413 and 613 and differs from them in that the likelihood is not as great. For example: int *p = 0; int i; for( i = 0; i &lt; n; i++ ) p = &amp;a[i]; *p = 0;

    The reason for partitioning the messages in this fashion is to allow the programmer to adopt the convention, advanced by some compilers (in particular gcc), of always placing a redundant set of parentheses around any assignment that is to be tested. In this case you can suppress Info 820 (via -e820) while still enabling Info 720.</description>

This message (836) could be issued if there were some intervening code involving k. See also Warning 690 in Section 13.3.</description>

    <description>An assignment statement was encountered that apparently obliterated a previously assigned value that had never had the opportunity of being used. For example, consider the following code fragment: y = 1; if( n &gt; 0 ) y = 2; y = 4; // Info 838 ... Here we can report that the assignment of 4 to y obliterates previously assigned values that were not used. We, of course, cannot report anything unusual about the assignment of 2. This will assign over a prior value of 1 that so far had not been used but the existence of an alternative path means that the value of 1 can still be employed later in the code and is accepted for the time being as reasonable.

    <description>An operand that can be deduced to always be 0 has been presented to an arithmetic operator in a context that arouses suspicion. The name of the operator is provided in the message as well as the side of the operator (left or right) that had the unusual value. For example: n = 0; k = m &amp; n; will produce a message that the right hand operand of operator '&amp;' is certain to be zero.
    The operands examined are the right hand sides of operators + - | || the left hand sides of operators / % and both sides of operators * &amp; &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; &amp;&amp; The reason that the left hand side of operator + (and friends) is not examined for zero is that zero is the identity operation for those operators and hence is often used as an initializing value. For example: sum = 0; for( ... ) sum = sum + what_ever; // OK, no message The message is not issued for arithmetic constant zeros. Info 835 in Section 13.4 is issued in that instance.

    <name>L0848: Worst case function for stack usage: String</name>
    <description>This message, issued at global wrap-up, will report on the function that requires the most stack. The stack required consists of the amount of auto storage the function requires plus the amounts required in any chain of functions called. The worst case chain is always reported.
    To obtain a report of all the function use the option -ok(filename).
    Reasonable allowances are made for function call overhead and the stack requirements of external functions. These assumptions can be controlled via the -stack option.
    If recursion is detected it will be reported here as this is considered worse than any finite case. The next worse case is that the stack can't be determined because a function makes a call through a function pointer. The function is said to be non-deterministic. If neither if these conditions prevail, the function that heads the worst case chain of calls will be reported upon.
    The message will normally provide you with the name of a called function. If the function is recursive this will provide you with the first call of a recursive loop. To determine the full loop, use option -ok(filename) which will contain a record for each function for which a definition was found. You will be able to follow the chain of calls to determine the recursive path.
    If you can assure yourself through code analysis that there is an upper bound to the amount of stack utilized by some recursive function then you can employ the -stack option to specify this bound. The function will no longer be considered recursive but rather finite. In this way, possibly through a sequence of options, you can progressively eliminate apparent recursion and in that way arrive at a safe upper bound for stack usage. Similar considerations apply for non-deterministic functions.</description>

    <description>Note: This message is delivered after the for loop has been completed.
    A for loop with an identifiable loop index variable was programmed in such a way that the loop body also modifies the index variable. For example: for( i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++ ) { a[i++] = 0; } In general it is better to restrict modifications to for loop index variables to the for clause if at all possible. If this is not possible, you can prefix the for loop with an appropriate lint comment such as: /*lint -e{850} i is modified in the body of the for loop */ The message is parameterized with a type category which is one of:
    integral some form of integer float some form of floating point number string some form of char * including wide char pointer some form of pointer other than string enumeration an enumeration of some kind unclassified none of the above
    This will allow you to be more selective in the delivery of messages because you may suppress or enable messages according to these classifications.

    <description>The variable cited in the message is either passed to a reference that is not a const reference or its address is passed to a pointer that is not a pointer to const. Hence the variable is potentially modified by the function. If the same variable is used elsewhere in the same expression, then the result may depend on the order of evaluation of the expression. For example: int g( int ); int h( int &amp; ); int f( int k ) { return g(k) + h(k); // Info 864 } Here the compiler is free to evaluate the call to g() first with the original value of k and then call h() where k gets modified. Alternatively, it can, with equal validity, call h() first in which case the value passed to g() would be the new value.
    The object being modified could be the implicit argument (the this argument) to a member function call. For example: void f( int, int ); class X { public: int bump(); int k; }; ... X x; f( x.bump(), x.bump() ); // Info 864 Here the message states that the expression involving object x possibly depends on the order of evaluation. x is an implicit argument (by reference) to the bump() member function.

Thus, this message does not necessarily indicate that there is anything wrong and could easily be supressed entirely.
    Moreover, if the pragma occurs in a libary header this message would not normally be issued because the option -wlib(1) would be in effect (this option is present in all of our compiler option files).
    But if the pragma occurs in user code then it should be examined to see if there is something there that might interest a lint processor. There are a variety of facilities to deal with pragmas; in particular, they can be mapped into languistic constructs or lint options or both.

    <description>This Note helps to locate non-portable data items within struct's. If instead of containing int's and unsigned int's, a struct were to contain short's and long's then the data would be more portable across machines and memory models.

    <name>L0947: Subtract operator applied to pointers</name>
    <description>An expression of the form p - q was found where both p and q are pointers. This is of special importance in cases where the maximum pointer can overflow the type that holds pointer differences. For example, suppose that the maximum pointer is 3 Gigabytes -1, and that pointer differences are represented by a long, where the maximum long is 2 Gigabytes -1. Note that both of these quantities fit within a 32 bit word. Then subtracting a small pointer from a very large pointer will produce an apparent negative value in the long representing the pointer difference. Conversely, subtracting a very large pointer from a small pointer can produce a positive quantity.
    The alert reader will note that a potential problem exists whenever the size of the type of a pointer difference equals the size of a pointer. But the problem doesn't usually manifest itself since the highest pointer values are usually less than what a pointer could theoretically hold. For this reason, the message cannot be given automatically based on scalar types and hence has been made an Elective Note.
    Compare this Note with that of 946 which was designed for a slightly different pointer difference problem.</description>

    <name>L0952: Parameter 'Symbol' (Location) could be declared const</name>
    <description>A parameter is not modified by a function. For example:
    int f( char *p, int n ) { return *p = n; }
    can be redeclared as:
    int f( char * const p, const int n ) { return *p = n; }
    There are few advantages to declaring an unchanging parameter a const. It signals to the person reading the code that a parameter is unchanging, but, in the estimate of most, reduces legibility. For this reason the message has been given an Elective Note status.
    However, there is a style of programming that encourages declaring parameters const. For the above example, this style would declare f as
    int f( char * p, int n);
    and would use the const qualifier only in the definition. Note that the two forms are compatible according to the standard. The declaration is considered the interface specification where the const's do not matter. The const's do matter in the definition of the function which is considered the implementation. Message 952 could be used to support this style.
    Marking a parameter as const does not affect the type of argument that can be passed to the parameter. In particular, it does not mean that only const arguments may be passed. This is in contrast to declaring a parameter as pointer to const or reference to const. For these situations, Informational messages are issued (818 and 1764 respectively) and these do affect the kinds of arguments that may be passed. See also messages 953 and 954.</description>

    <description>A local variable (either static or auto) is initialized but never modified thereafter. Such a variable could be declared const. One advantage in making such a declaration is that it can furnish a clue to the program reader that the variable is unchanging. In the case of static data it can mean that the data is ROM'able. Other situations in which a const can be added to a declaration are covered in messages 818, 952, 954 and 1764.</description>

    <description>The data pointed to by a pointer is never changed (at least not through that pointer). It may therefore be better, or at least more descriptive, if the variable were typed pointer to const. For example: { char *p = "abc"; for( ; *p; p++ ) print(*p); }
    can be redeclared as: { const char *p = "abc"; for( ; *p; p++ ) print(*p); }
    It is interesting to contrast this situation with that of pointer parameters. The latter is given Informational status (818) because it has an effect of enhancing the set of pointers that can be passed into a function. Other situations in which a const can be added to a declaration are covered in messages 952, 953 and 1764.</description>

    <name>L0956: Non const, non volatile static or external variable 'Symbol'</name>
    <description>This check has been advocated by programmers whose applications are multi-threaded. Software that contains modifiable data of static duration is often non-reentrant. That is, two or more threads cannot run the code concurrently. By 'static duration' we mean variables declared static or variables declared external to any function. For example: int count = 0; void bump() { count++; } void get_count() { return count; }
    If the purpose is to obtain a count of all the bump()'s by a given thread then this program clearly will not do since the global variable count sums up the bump()'s from all the threads. Moreover, if the purpose of the code is to obtain a count of all bump()'s by all threads, it still may contain a subtle error (depending on the compiler and the machine). If it is possible to interrupt a thread between the access of count and the subsequent store, then two threads that are bump()'ing at the same time, may register an increase in the count by just one.
    Please note that not all code is intended to be re-entrant. In fact most programs are not designed that way and so this Elective Note need not be enabled for the majority of programs. If the program is intended to be re-entrant, all uses of non-const static variables should be examined carefully for non-reentrant properties.</description>

    <description>This message is given whenever padding is necessary within a struct to achieve a required member alignment. Consider: struct A { char c; int n; }; Assuming that int must be aligned on a 4-byte boundary and assuming the size of a char to be 1, then this message will be issued indicating that there will be a padding of 3 bytes.
    The alignment requirements vary with the compiler, the machine and, sometimes, compiler options. When separately compiled programs need to share data at the binary level it helps to remove any artificially created padding from any of the structures that may be shared.</description>

    <description>The alignment of a structure (or union) is equal to the maximum alignment of any of its members. When an array of structures is allocated, the compiler ensures that each structure is allocated at an address with the proper alignment. This will require padding if the size of the structure is not an even multiple of its maximum alignment. For example: struct A { int n; char ch; } a[10]; Assuming the size and alignment of int is 4 then the size of each struct is 5 but its alignment is 4. As a result each struct in the array will be padded with 3 bytes.
    Alignment can vary with the compiler and the machine. If binary data is to be shared by separately compiled modules, it is safer to make sure that all shared structures and unions are explicitly padded.</description>

The message will contain the word 'follows' rather than the word 'precedes'.
    There is a diametrically opposite convention, viz. that of placing the qualifier after the type. As the message itself reminds the user you will obtain the reverse test if you turn off the fqb (place qualifiers before types) flag. Thus //lint -fqb turn off the Qualifiers Before types flag //lint +e963 report on type-qualifier inversion extern const char *p; // Note 963 extern char const *p; Note that the use of this flag will cause 'follows' in the message to be replaced by 'precedes' and the alternative option mentioned within the 'use' clause is changed to its opposite orientation.

    <name>L0970: Use of modifier or type 'Name' outside of a typedef</name>
    <description>Some standards require the use of type names (defined in typedef's) in preference to raw names used within the text of the program. For example they may want you to use INT32 rather than int where INT32 is typedef's as:
    typedef int INT32;
    This message is normally issued for the standard intrinsic types: bool, char, wchar_t, int, float, double, and for modifiers unsigned, signed, short and long. You may enable this message and then suppress the message for individual types to obtain special effects. For example the following will enable the message for all but bool.

    <description>The 'char' type was specified without an explicit modifier to indicate whether the char was signed or unsigned. The plain char type can be regarded by the compiler as identifying a signed or an unsigned quantity whichever is more efficient to implement. Because of this ambiguity, some standards do not like the use of char without an explicit modifier to indicate its signedness.</description>

    <name>L0974: Worst case function for stack usage: String</name>
    <description>This message, issued at global wrap-up, will report on the function that requires the most stack. The stack required consists of the amount of auto storage the function requires plus the amounts required in any chain of functions called. The worst case chain is always reported.
    To obtain a report of all the functions, use the +stack option.
    Reasonable allowances are made for function call overhead and the stack requirements of external functions. These assumptions can be controlled via the +stack option.
    If recursion is detected it will be reported here, as this is considered worse than any finite case. The next worse case is that the stack can't be determined because a function makes a call through a function pointer. The function is said to be non-deterministic. If neither of these conditions prevail, the function that heads the worst case chain of calls will be reported upon.
    The message will normally provide you with the name of a called function. If the function is recursive this will provide you with the first call of a recursive loop. To determine the full loop, you will need a full stack report as obtained with the +stack option. You need a suboption of the form &amp;file=file to specify a file which will contain a record for each function for which a definition was found. You will be able to follow the chain of calls to determine the recursive path.
    If you can assure yourself through code analysis that there is an upper bound to the amount of stack utilized by some recursive function, then you can employ the +stack option to specify the bound for this function. The function will no longer be considered recursive but rather finite. In this way, possibly through a sequence of options, you can progressively eliminate apparent recursion and in that way arrive at a safe upper bound for stack usage. Similar considerations apply for non-deterministic functions.</description>

    <name>L0975: Unrecognized pragma 'Name' will be ignored</name>
    <description>The first identifier after #pragma is considered the name of the pragma. If the name is unrecognized then the remainder of the line is ignored. Since the purpose of #pragma is to allow for compiler-dependent communication it is not really expected that all pragmas will be understood by all third-party processors of the code. Thus, this message does not necessarily indicate that there is anything wrong and could easily be supressed entirely.
    Moreover, if the pragma occurs in a libary header this message would not normally be issued because the option -wlib(1) would be in effect (this option is present in all of our compiler option files).
    But if the pragma occurs in user code then it should be examined to see if there is something there that might interest a lint processor. There are a variety of facilities to deal with pragmas; in particular, they can be mapped into languistic constructs or lint options or both. See 3.5 pragmas push_macro and pop_macro and 3.6 Casting pragmas as macros.</description>

    <description>A reference is normally initialized with an lvalue. If you attempt to initialize a reference with a non-lvalue, a temporary is created to serve as a surrogate lvalue. However, modifications made to the temporary will be lost. This was legal at one time and is now illegal. Make the reference a const if you can. You may be initializing a reference without realizing it. A member function has an implicit parameter which is taken to be a reference to its object. If this is the situation make the member const.

    <description>When the language calls for a class template to be instantiated and the primary template is "overloaded" via one or more partial specializations, there is an attempt to see if the template arguments match any of those partial specializations. (Note, explicit specializations would have been considered before determining that the class definition needs to be generated by way of instantiation.) If multiple partial specializations match then:
    - If one of the matching partial specializations is more specialized than all others then it is used for the instantiation.
    - Otherwise, the program is ill-formed, so Lint issues message 1084.
    In the message, the matching partial specializations are provided as the list of candidates. Example: template&lt;class T1, class T2, int I&gt; class A {}; //#1 template&lt;class T1, class T2, int I&gt; class A&lt;T1*, T2, I&gt; {}; //#2 template&lt;class T1, class T2, int I&gt; class A&lt;T1, T2*, I&gt; {}; //#3 A&lt;int*, int*, 2&gt; a; // ambiguous: matches #2 and #3 // (and neither template is more specialized than the other)</description>

    // template &lt;&gt; // Would be ill-formed by ISO C++. // struct B&lt;int&gt; {}; }; template&lt;&gt; struct A::B&lt;int&gt; {}; // Ok. There is an additional limitation with member class templates of class templates. As with members of a non-template class, one cannot write a specialization at class scope. Example: template&lt;typename T&gt; struct G { template &lt;typename U&gt; struct H {}; // template &lt;&gt; // Would be ill-formed by ISO C++. // struct H&lt;int&gt; {}; }; But the language specification does not even allow this to be expressed in a namespace-scope definition; there is no way to write an explicit specialization that is a member of a class template. Example: template&lt;typename T&gt; struct J { template &lt;typename U&gt; struct K {}; }; // template&lt;typename T&gt; // template &lt;&gt; // Would be ill-formed by ISO C++; // struct J&lt;T&gt;::K&lt;int&gt; {}; This is because the rules for explicit specializations say that 'template&lt;&gt;' is not allowed to appear after a non-empty template-parameter-list within the same declaration. However, one may write an explicit specialization that is a member of an implicitly-instantiated specialization of a class template. Example: template&lt;typename T&gt; struct L { template &lt;typename U&gt; struct M {}; }; template &lt;&gt; template &lt;&gt; struct L&lt;char&gt;::M&lt;int&gt; {}; // Ok Here, the body of the class L&lt;char&gt; is automatically generated by implicit instantiation (otherwise the reference to 'L&lt;char&gt;::M' would be ill-formed), while the body of L&lt;char&gt;::M&lt;int&gt; is provided in the explicit specialization.
    In March of 2009, the ISO C++ committee reviewed a report submitted against this example: struct A { template&lt;class T&gt; struct B; template &lt;class T&gt; struct B&lt;T*&gt; { }; // well-formed template &lt;&gt; struct B&lt;int*&gt; { }; // ill-formed }; While it might seem odd that one is able to write the partial specialization but not the full specialization, the committee (which at the time was in a "feature-freeze" mode and trying to finalize a draft for the next International Standard) decided that this capability would need to be regarded as an "extension", meaning that it could be considered as a new feature in a future standard but not as a bug-fix for C++0x.
    Note that the Microsoft compiler implements this extension. For that reason, the Lint option -elib(1111) appears in recent versions of our configuration files for Microsoft compilers.</description>

According to the C++ standard (Section 12.2), in addressing the issue of binding temporary values to references, says "A temporary bound to the returned value in a function return statement ... persists until the function exits". Thus the information being returned is not guaranteed to last longer than the function being called.
    It would probably be better to return by value rather than reference. Alternatively, you may return a static variable by reference. This will have validity at least until the next call upon the same function.</description>

A POD is fully defined in the C++ standard (Clause 9).
    Some functions such as memcpy, memcmp, memmove, etc. are expected to be given only pointers to POD objects. The reason is that only POD objects have the property that they can be copied to an array of bytes and back again with a guarantee that they will retain their original value.

    It is important to check for a self assignment so as to know whether the old value should be subject to a delete operation. This is often overlooked by a class designer since it is counter-intuitive to assign to oneself. But through the magic of aliasing (pointers, references, function arguments) it is possible for an unsuspecting programmer to stumble into a disguised self-assignment [12, Item 17].

    <description>A variable (identified by Symbol) was used in the run-time initialization of a static variable. However this variable itself was initialized at run-time. Since the order of initialization cannot be predicted this is the source of possible error.
    Whereas addresses are completely known at initialization time values may not be. Whether the value or merely the address of a variable is used in the initialization of a second variable is not an easy thing to determine when an argument is passed by reference or via pointer. For example, class X { X( const X &amp; ); };
    extern X x1; X x2 = x1; X x1 = x2;
    It is theoretically possible, but unlikely, that the constructor X() is interested only in the address of its argument and not its current value. If so, it only means you will be getting a spurious report which you can suppress based on variable name. However, if the const is missing when passing a reference parameter (or a pointer parameter) then we cannot easily assume that values are being used. In this case no report will be issued. The moral is that if you want to get the checking implied by this message you should make your constructor reference arguments const.</description>

    Typically the message is given on initializing a non-const reference with a const. For example: void f( int &amp;x ); const int n = 0; ... f(n); Here, function f() could assign a value to its argument and thereby modify n which is declared to be const.
    The message can also be issued when a pointer is initialized. Consider the following example. void h( const int *&amp;q ); int *p; ... h(p); It might seem that passing a regular (i.e., non-const) pointer to a const int * could cause no harm. That would be correct if it were not for the reference. If function h() were to assign a pointer to const to its parameter q then upon return from the call, p could be used to modify const data.

    <description>When a class (or union or enum) is declared within a namespace that namespace is said to be associated with the type. A Generic function template is any that has as parameters only intrinsic types or plain template arguments possibly adorned with reference or const or volatile qualification. Consider namespace X { template&lt; class T &gt; void f( int, const T&amp; ); // Generic class A{}; // Warning 1573 } A call to function f that contained an argument of type X::A would, by ADL (Argument Dependent Lookup), need to also consider function X::f even though this function was not in the scope of the call. In the past this has led to strange an unexpected results.
    Some designers adopt the strategy of embedding the class within a sub namespace and employing a using-declaration to make it available to users of the original namespace. For example: namespace X { template&lt; class T &gt; void f( int, const T&amp; ); // Generic namespace X1 { class A{}; // No Warning } using X1::A; } Now an argument of type X::A will not automatically trigger a consideration of X::f.</description>

Some compilers protect against this eventuality by refusing to create a default assignment operator for classes containing references. Similar remarks can be made about copy constructors.

    <description>Within a constructor for the cited class, there appeared a new. However, no copy constructor was declared for this class. Presumably, because of the new, some class member (or members) points to dynamically allocated memory. Such memory is not treated properly by the default copy constructor. Normally a custom copy constructor would be needed. [12, Item 11]</description>

    <description>A virtual function was detected with a default parameter. For example: class B { virtual void f( int n = 5 ); ... };
    The difficulty is that every virtual function f overriding this virtual function must contain a default parameter and its default parameter must be identical to that shown above. If this is not done, no warnings are issued but behavior may have surprising effects. This is because when f() is called through a base class pointer (or reference) the function is determined from the actual type (the dynamic type) and the default argument is determined from the nominal type (the static type).

    <description>The designated symbol is a member function declared as const. Though technically valid, the const may be misleading because the member function modifies (or exposes) information indirectly referenced by the object. For example: class X { char *pc; char &amp; get(int i) const { return pc[i]; } };
    results in Info 1763 for function X::get. This is because the function exposes information indirectly held by the class X.
    Experts [24] recommend that a pair of functions be made available in this situation: class X { char *pc; const char &amp; get(int i) const { return pc[i]; } char &amp; get(int i) { return pc[i]; } };

The danger of this is that the reference may designate a temporary variable that will not persist long after the call. For example: const int *f( const int &amp; n ) { return &amp;n; } int g(); const int *p = f( g() ); Here, p points to a temporary value whose duration is not guaranteed. If the reference is not const then you will get Elective Note 1940.

    <description>A line is found that ends with a return keyword and with no other tokens following. Did the programmer forget to append a semi-colon? The problem with this is that the next expression is then consumed as part of the return statement. Your return might be doing more that you thought. For example: void f( int n, int m ) { if( n &lt; 0 ) return // do not print when n is negative print( n ); print( m ); } Assuming print() returns void, this is entirely legal but is probably not what you intended. Instead of printing n and m, for n not negative you print just m. For n negative you print n.
    To avoid this problem always follow the return keyword with something on the same line. It could be a semi-colon, an expression or, for very large expressions, some portion of an expression.</description>

    <name>L1792: Assignment operator for class 'Symbol' does not return a const reference to class</name>
    <description>The typical use of an assignment operator for class C is to assign new information to variables of class C. If this were the entire story there would be no need for the assignment operator to return anything. However, it is conventional to support chains of assignment as in: C x, y, z; ... x = y = z; // parsed as x = (y = z); For this reason assignment normally returns a reference to the object assigned the value. For example, assignment (y = z) would return a reference to y.
    Since it is almost never the case that this variable is to be reassigned, i.e. we almost never wish to write: (x = y) = z; // unusual as a general rule it is better to make the assignment operator return a const reference. This will generate a warning when the unusual case is attempted.
    But experts differ. Some maintain that in order to support non-const member functions operating directly on the result of an assignment as in: (x = y).mangle(); where, as its name suggests, mangle is non-const it would be necessary for the return value of assignment to be non-const. Others would argue that this code could easily be replaced by a pair of expressions but if you want to support this style of programming then you should suppress this message.</description>

    <name>L1793: While calling 'Symbol': Initializing the implict object parameter 'Type' (a non-const reference) with a non-lvalue</name>
    <description>A non-static and non-const member function was called and an rvalue (a temporary object) of class type was used to initialize the implicit object parameter. This is legal (and possibly intentional) but suspicious. Consider the following. struct A { void f(); }; ... A().f(); // Info 1793 ... In the above the 'non-static, non-const member function' is A::f(). The 'implicit object parameter' for the call to A::f() is A(), a temporary. Since the A::f() is non-const it presumably modifies A(). But since A() is a temporary, any such change is lost. It would at first blush appear to be a mistake.
    The Standard normally disallows binding a non-const reference to an rvalue (see Error 1058 in the manual), but as a special case allows it for the binding of the implicit object parameter in member function calls. Some popular libraries take advantage of this rule in a legitimate way. For example, the GNU implementation of std::vector&lt;bool&gt;::operator[] returns a temporary object of type std::_Bit_reference -- a class type with a non-const member operator=(). _Bit_reference serves a dual purpose. If a value is assigned to it, it modifies the original class through its operator=(). If a value is extracted from it, it obtains that value from the original class through its operator bool().
    Probably the best policy to take with this message is to examine instances of it and if this is a library invocation or a specially designed class, then suppress the message with a -esym() option.</description>

Added Bibliography, [34], the names of N::f(A) and Q::f(A) will coexist in the global namespace (along with the names of the other overloads of f). This alone does not make the program ill-formed. (For that you would have to make some use of the name 'f' that resulted in overload resolution where f(A) is selected.) However, a user of N and Q may be surprised to find that both library namespaces supply a function f that operates on ::A objects, and that both have been introduced into the same scope.

    Confusion can arise in determining which of the two function templates the specialization is actually specializing.

    <description>This message is given when an empty prototype is detected either for a function definition or for a namespace declaration (the String specifies which).

    int f(); // Info 1717 int f() { return 1; } // Elective Note 1917
    The reason for this is that the declaration form has a different meaning in C and C++. In C it is an incomplete declaration saying nothing about arguments. In C++ the declaration says there are no arguments. The definition, however, means the same in both languages. See also message 1918. [11, ?8.2.5]</description>

Some programmers consider such implicit calls to be potentially harmful leading to programming situations that are difficult to diagnose. See for example [23, Item 5].</description>

    <description>A constructor was found that could be used for implicit conversions. For example: class X { public: X(int); ... };
    Here, any int (or type convertible to int) could be automatically converted to X. This can sometimes cause confusing behavior [23, Item 5]. If this is not what was intended, use the keyword 'explicit' as in: explicit X(int);

    <name>L1933: Call to unqualified virtual function 'Symbol' from non-static member function</name>
    <description>A classical C++ gotcha is the calling of a virtual function from within a constructor or a destructor. When we discover a direct call from a constructor or destructor to a virtual function we issue Warning 1506. But what about indirect calls. Suppose a constructor calls a function that in turn, perhaps through several levels of call, calls a virtual function. This could be difficult to detect. Dan Saks [24] has suggested a compromise Guideline that "imposes few, if any, practical restrictions". The Guideline, implemented by this Elective Note, issues a message whenever an unqualified virtual function is called by any other (non-static) member function (for the same 'this' object). For example: class X { virtual void f(); void g(); };
    void X::g() { f(); // Note 1933 X::f(); // ok -- non virtual call. }
    Even if total abstinence is unwarranted, turning on message 1933 occasionally can be helpful in detecting situations when constructors or destructors call virtual functions.</description>

    <description>It has been suggested [12, Item 19] that you should never make a shift operator a member function unless you're defining ostream or istream (the message is suppressed in these two cases). The reason is that there is a temptation on the part of the novice to, for example, define output to ostream as a class member function left shift that takes ostream as an argument. This is exactly backwards. The shift operator normally employs the destination (or source) on the left.
    On the other hand, if the class you are defining is the source or destination then defining the shift operators is entirely appropriate.</description>

    <name>L1935: Dynamic initialization for class object 'Symbol1' (references 'Symbol2')</name>
    <description>A static class-like object whose name is Symbol1 is dynamically initialized by referencing Symbol2 (the latter is normally a constructor for the former). The reason for noting this initialization is that the order of inter-module dynamic initializations is not defined. (Within a module, however, the intializations are done in the order of appearance.) Hence, if the constructor is itself dependent on dynamic initialization occurring in another module the behavior is undefined. For example: class X { X(): ... };
    X x:
    This will elicit Elective Note 1935 that x is being initialized dynamically by a call to X::X(). Now, if this constructor were to be accessing information that depended on the order of evaluation (such as accessing the value of x itself) the result would be undefined. We have no evidence of this at this point. and for this reason the message is in the Elective Note category. However, programmers with a suspected order-of-initialization problem will probably want to turn this on. See also 1936, 1937, 1544 and 1545.</description>

    Here we report that n is dynamically initialized by f(). There may be other symbols referenced, Symbol2 is just the first. The reason for noting this initialization is that the order of inter-module dynamic initializations is not defined. (Within a module, however, the initializations are done in the order of appearance.) If Symbol2 were a variable, then PC-lint/FlexeLint could determine that the variable is dynamically initialized in another module and issue a 1544 or 1545 as appropriate. However, the symbol referenced could be a function (as in the example) and PC-lint/FlexeLint does not analyze the complete function call graph to determine whether there is a dependency on another dynamic initialization.

    <description>The address of a reference parameter is being transferred (either via a return statement, assigned to a static, or assigned through a pointer parameter) to a point where it can persist beyond the lifetime of the function. These are all violations of the Linton Convention (see Murray [21]).
    The particular instance at hand is with a reference to a non-const and as such is not considered as dangerous as with a reference to a const. (See 1780, 1781 and 1782 in Section 13.8 Informational Messages for those cases). For example: int *f( int &amp;n ) { return &amp;n; } int g(); int *p = f( g() ); would create a problem were it not for the fact that this is diagnosed as a non-lvalue being assigned to a reference to non-const.</description>

    <name>L1941: Assignment operator for class 'Symbol' does not return a const reference to class</name>
    <description>The typical use of an assignment operator for class C is to assign new information to variables of class C. If this were the entire story there would be no need for the assignment operator to return anything. However, it is conventional to support chains of assignment as in: C x, y, z; ... x = y = z; // parsed as x = (y = z); For this reason assignment normally returns a reference to the object assigned the value. For example, assignment (y = z) would return a reference to y.
    Since it is almost never the case that this variable is to be reassigned, i.e. we almost never wish to write: (x = y) = z; // unusual as a general rule it is better to make the assignment operator return a const reference. This will generate a warning when the unusual case is attempted.
    But experts differ. Some maintain that in order to support non-const member functions operating directly on the result of an assignment as in: (x = y).mangle(); where, as its name suggests, mangle is non-const it would be necessary for the return value of assignment to be non-const. Another reason to not insist on the const qualifier is that the default assignment operator returns simply a reference to object and not a reference to const object. In an age of generic programming, compatibility may more important than the additional protection that the const would offer.</description>

    <description>An unqualified name used within a class template was not found within the class and, moreover, the class has at least one dependent base class. There is a potential ambiguity here. According to the standard, the dependent base class should not be searched either at template definition time or at template instantiation time. Nonetheless, some implementations do make that search at instantiation time. Even if the compiler is conforming, the implementator or even a reader of the code may think the base class is searched leading to confusion.
    To eliminate the ambiguity, the name should be fully qualified (or referenced using this). For example: class X; template&lt; class T &gt; class A : T { X *p; bool f() { return y; } }; Both the reference to X (on line 5) and to y (one line 6) will be flagged. One possible modification is: class X; template&lt; class T &gt; class A : T { ::X *p; bool f() { return this-&gt;y; } }; This solidifies and disambiguates the code. The reference to X is guaranteed to be the X on line 1 and can no longer be high-jacked by the base class. Also, since y is not a member of A, the class will not instantiate unless y is found to be a member of the base class.</description>

    <description>This message is similar to message 1762 (member function could be made const) except that it is issued for a virtual function. You may not want to make virtual functions const because then any overriding function would have to be const as well. Consider, for example: class A { virtual void f() {} /* ... */ }; class B : public A { int a; void f() { a = 0; } };
    Here, class B overrides A's function f() and, in doing so, modifies member a. If A::f() had been declared const, this would not have been possible.
    Nonetheless, a particularly rigorous user may want to hunt down such virtual functions and make them all const and so this Note is provided.
    This message is also similar to Note 1962 which is issued for functions that make deep modifications. Note 1962 takes priority over 1961. That is, a virtual function that makes a deep modification (but no shallow modifications) will have Note 1962 issued but not Note 1961.</description>

    <description>It has been deemed safer by some experts that the block (i.e. compound statement) containing the goto should be the same as or nested within the block containing the label.  Thus
     
           {  label:  {  goto label;  }  }
     
       is permitted but
     
           {  goto label;  {  label:  }  }
     
       is not.  To assist the programmer, the message refers to the blocks using an identification code (Example: "1.2.1").  This identification scheme is defined as follows.
         (a) The outer block has an identification of 1.
         (b) If a particular block is identified by x then its immediate subblocks, if any, are identified as x.1, x.2, x.3, etc.

       Thus in the following 'code',
     
           {  {  }  { { label: } { } } }
     
       label: lies in block 1.2.1.</description>
