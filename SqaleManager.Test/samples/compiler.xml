    <description>
      Single-line comments are standard in C++ and nonstandard in
      C. Under strict ANSI compatibility (/Za), C files that contain
      single-line comments, generate C4001 due to the usage of a nonstandard
      extension. Since single-line comments are standard in C++, C files
      containing single-line comments do not produce C4001 when compiling
      with Microsoft extensions (/Ze).

      To suppress C4250, use the warning pragma.
      Because a virtual base class is shared among multiple derived classes, a name in a derived class dominates a name in a base class. For example, given the following class hierarchy, there are two definitions of func inherited within diamond: the vbc::func() instance through the weak class, and the dominant::func() through the dominant class. An unqualified call of func() through a diamond class object, always calls the dominate::func() instance. If the weak class were to introduce an instance of func(), neither definition would dominate, and the call would be flagged as ambiguous.

      To minimize the possibility of data corruption when exporting a class with __declspec(dllexport), ensure that:
      - All your static data is access through functions that are exported from the DLL.
      - No inlined methods of your class can modify static data.
      - No inlined methods of your class use CRT functions or other library functions use static data (see Potential Errors Passing CRT Objects Across DLL Boundaries for more information).
      - No methods of your class (regardless of inlining) can use types where the instantiation in the EXE and DLL have static data differences.
      You can avoid exporting classes by defining a DLL that defines a class with virtual functions, and functions you can call to instantiate and delete objects of the type. You can then just call virtual functions on the type.
      C4251 can be ignored if you are deriving from a type in the Standard C++ Library, compiling a debug release (/MTd) and where the compiler error message refers to _Container_base.

    <description>
      Possible incompatibility.
      Consider the following code example. If the definition of the constructor S2::S2( int i, ... ) was compiled by using a version of the Visual C++ compiler before version 7, but the following example is compiled by using the current version, the call to the constructor for S3 would not work correctly because of a special-case calling-convention change. If both were compiled by using Visual C++ 6.0, the call would not work quite right either, unless no parameters were passed for the ellipsis.
      To fix this warning,
      - Don't use ellipsis in a constructor.
      - Make sure that all components in their project are built with the current version (including any libraries that may define or reference this class), then disable the warning using the warning pragma.

    <description>
      An exported class was derived from a class that was not exported.
      To minimize the possibility of data corruption when exporting a class with __declspec(dllexport), ensure that:
      - All your static data is accessed through functions that are exported from the DLL.
      - No inlined methods of your class can modify static data.
      - No inlined methods of your class use CRT functions or other library functions use static data.
      - No inlined class functions use CRT functions, or other library functions, where, for example, you access static data.
      - No methods of your class (regardless of inlining) can use types where the instantiation in the EXE and DLL have static data differences.
      You can avoid exporting classes by defining a DLL that defines a class with virtual functions, and functions you can call to instantiate and delete objects of the type. You can then just call virtual functions on the type.
      C4275 can be ignored in Visual C++ if you are deriving from a type in the Standard C++ Library, compiling a debug release (/MTd) and where the compiler error message refers to _Container_base.

    <description>
      A placement new is used for which there is no placement delete.
      When memory is allocated for an object with operator new, the object's constructor is called. If the constructor throws an exception, any memory that was allocated for the object should be deallocated. This cannot take place unless an operator delete function exists that matches the operator new.
      If you use the operator new without any extra arguments and compile with /GX, /EHs, or /EHa options to enable exception handling, the compiler will generate code to call operator delete if the constructor throws an exception.
      If you use the placement form of the new operator (the form with arguments in addition to the size of the allocation) and the object's constructor throws an exception, the compiler will still generate code to call operator delete; but it will only do so if a placement form of operator delete exists matching the placement form of the operator new that allocated the memory.

      An rvalue cannot be bound to a non-const reference. In previous versions of Visual C++, it was possible to bind an rvalue to a non-const reference in a direct initialization. This code now gives a warning.
      For backward compatibility, it is still possible to bind rvalues to non-const references, but standard conversions are preferred wherever possible.
      This warning represents a change of behavior from the Visual C++ .NET 2002 compiler. If enabled, this warning could possibly be given for correct code. For example, it could be given when using the std::auto_ptr class template.
      If you get this warning, examine your code to see if it depends on binding rvalues to non-const references. Adding a const to the reference or providing a additional const-reference overload may solve the problem.

    <name>warning C4351: new behavior: elements of array 'array' will be default initialized</name>
    <description>
      When an array is in a constructor's member initialization list, the elements of the array will be default initialized. In previous versions of Visual C++, when an array was in a constructor's member initialization list, the elements of the array may not have been default initialized in some cases.
      If the array's element type does not have a constructor, the elements of the array will be initialized with the corresponding zero representation for that type.
      C4351 means that you should inspect your code. If you want the compiler's previous behavior, remove the array from the constructor's member initialization list.
      If you want the new behavior, which is likely, because the array was explicitly added to the constructor's member initialization list, use the warning pragma to disable the warning. The new behavior should be fine for most users.
      One situation where the new behavior can result in unexpected behavior is when placement new is used to construct the object that has the array as a member, and the program depends on the contents that the memory (for the elements of the default initialized array) had before the call to placement new. In this case, the older compiler would have left the contents of memory unchanged, but the new behavior will cause default initialization of the array elements, overwriting the original contents in memory.

    <description>
      An incorrect cast was detected.
      C4407 can be generated because of compiler conformance work that was done in Visual C++ 2005. Pointer-to-member now requires a qualified name and the address-of operator (&amp;).
      C4407 can occur if you cast between a multiple inheritance pointer-to-member to a single inheritance pointer-to-member. Sometimes this can work, but sometimes it can’t because the single inheritance pointer-to-member representation doesn’t hold sufficient information. Compiling with the /vmm might help (for more information, see /vmm, /vms, /vmv (General Purpose Representation)). You can also try rearranging your base classes; the compiler is detecting a loss of information in the conversion because a base class is at a non-zero offset from the derived.

    <name>warning C4412: 'function' : function signature contains type 'type'; C++ objects are unsafe to pass between pure code and mixed or native.</name>
    <description>
      The compiler detected a potentially unsafe situation that could result in a runtime error: a call is being made from a /clr:pure compiland to a function that was imported via dllimport and the function signature contains an unsafe type. A type is unsafe if it contains a member function or has a data member that is an unsafe type or an indirection to an unsafe type.
      This is unsafe because of the difference in the default calling conventions between pure and native code (or mixed native and managed). When importing (via dllimport) a function into a /clr:pure compiland, ensure that the declarations of each type in the signature are identical to those in the compiland that exports the function (being especially careful about differences in implicit calling conventions).
      A virtual member function is especially prone to give unexpected results. However, even a non-virtual function should be tested to ensure that you get the correct results. If you are sure that you are getting the correct results, you can ignore this warning.
      For more information on /clr:pure, see How to: Migrate to /clr:pure (C++/CLI).
      C4412 is off by default. See Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default and dllexport, dllimport for more information.
      To resolve this warning, remove all functions from the type.

    <description>
      Short jumps generate compact instruction which branches to an address within a limited range from the instruction. The instruction includes a short offset that represents the distance between the jump and the target address, the function definition. During linking a function may be moved or subject to link-time optimizations that cause the function to be moved out of the range reachable from a short offset. The compiler must generate a special record for the jump, which requires the jmp instruction to be either NEAR or FAR. The compiler made the conversion.

    <description>
      The decorated name was longer than the compiler limit (4096), and was truncated. To avoid this warning and the truncation, reduce the number of arguments or name length of identifiers used.
      One situation where this warning will be issued is when your code contains templates specialized on templates repeatedly. For example, a map of maps (from the Standard C++ Library). In this situation, you can make your typedefs a type (struct, for example) that contains the map.
      You might, however, decide to not restructure your code. It is possible to ship an application that generates C4503, but if you get link time errors on a truncated symbol, it will be more difficult to determine the type of the symbol in the error. Debugging will also be more difficult; the debugger will also have difficultly mapping symbol name to type name. The correctness of the program, however, is unaffected by the truncated name.

    <description>
      The compiler cannot generate an assignment operator for the given class. No assignment operator was created.
      An assignment operator for the base class that is not accessible by the derived class can cause this warning.
      To avoid this warning, specify a user-defined assignment operator for the class.
      The compiler will also generate an assignment operator function for a class that does not define one. This assignment operator is a memberwise copy of the data members of an object. Because const data items cannot be modified after initialization, if the class contains a const item, the default assignment operator would not work. Another cause of the C4512 warning is a declaration of a nonstatic data member of reference type.
      You can resolve the C4512 warning for your code in one of three ways:
      - Explicitly define an assignment operator for the class.
      - Remove const or the reference operator from the data item in the class.
      - Use the #pragma warning statement to suppress the warning.

      The compiler encountered one of the following keywords:
      - continue
      - break
      - goto
      causing a jump out of a __finally or finally block during abnormal termination.
      If an exception occurs, and while the stack is being unwound during execution of the termination handlers (the __finally or finally blocks), and your code jumps out of a __finally block before the __finally block ends, the behavior is undefined. Control may not return to the unwinding code, so the exception may not be handled properly.
      If you must jump out of a __finally block, check for abnormal termination first.
      The following sample generates C4532; simply comment out the jump statements to resolve the warnings.

    <name>warning C4571: Informational: catch(...) semantics changed since Visual C++ 7.1; structured exceptions (SEH) are no longer caught</name>
    <description>
      C4571 is generated for every catch(...) block when compiling with /EHs.
      When compiling with /EHs, a catch(...) block will not catch a structured exception (divide by zero, null pointer, for example); a catch(...) block will only catch explicitly-thrown, C++ exceptions. For more information, see Exception Handling in Visual C++.
      This warning is off by default. Turn this warning on to ensure that when you compile with /EHs your catch (...) blocks do not intend to catch structured exceptions. See Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default for more information.
      You can resolve C4571 in one of the following ways,
      - Compile with /EHa if you still want your catch(...) blocks to catch structured exceptions.
      - Do not enable C4571 if you do not want your catch(...) blocks to catch structured exceptions, but you still want to use catch(...) blocks. You can still catch structured exceptions using the structured exception handling keywords (__try, __except, and __finally). But remember, when compiled /EHs destructors will only be called when a C++ exception is thrown, not when an SEH exception occurs.
      - Replace catch(...) block with catch blocks for specific C++ exceptions, and optionally, add structured exception handling around the C++ exception handling (__try, __except, and __finally). See Structured Exception Handling (C++) for more information.
      See /EH (Exception Handling Model) for more information.

    <description>
      The metadata file containing the original type definition is not referenced, and the compiler is using a local type definition.
      In the case where you are rebuilding file, C4691 can be ignored or turned off with pragma warning. That is, if the file you are building is the same as the file where the compiler expects to find the type definition, you can ignore C4691.
      However, unexpected behavior can occur if the compiler uses a definition that is not from the same assembly that is referenced in metadata; CLR types are typed not only by the name of the type, but also by the assembly. That is, a type Z from assembly z.dll is different from a type Z from assembly y.dll

      Inlining is performed at the compiler's discretion. The inline keyword, like the register keyword, is used as a hint for the compiler. The compiler uses heuristics to determine if it should inline a particular function to speed up the code when compiling for speed, or if it should inline a particular function to make the code smaller when compiling for space. The compiler will only inline very small functions when compiling for space.
      In some cases, the compiler will not inline a particular function for mechanical reasons. See C4714 for a list of reasons the compiler may not inline a function.

      There is important case when this warning can be emitted for C++. If you declare the same types with the same name in two different files, if those declarations contain virtual functions, and if the declarations are not the same, then the compiler can emit warning C4744 for the virtual function tables. The warning occurs because there are two different sized virtual function tables for the same type, and linker must choose one of them to incorporate into the executable. It is possible that this can result in your program calling the wrong virtual function.

    <description>
      Warns about buffer overrun when specific C run-time (CRT) functions are used, parameters are passed, and assignments are performed, such that the data sizes are known at compile time. This warning is for situations that might elude typical data-size mismatch detection.
      The warning appears when data, whose length is known at compile time, is copied and put into a data block whose size is known at compile time to be too small for the data. The copy must be done by using the intrinsic form of one of the following CRT functions:
      - strcpy
      - memset
      - memcpy, wmemcpy
      The warning also appears when a parameter datatype is mismatched by using a cast, and then a copy assignment from an lvalue reference is attempted.
      Visual C++ might generate this warning for a code path that does not ever execute. You can temporarily disable the warning by using #pragma, as shown in this example:
      #pragma(push)
      #pragma warning ( disable : 4789 )
      // unused code that generates compiler warning C4789
      #pragma(pop)
      This keeps Visual C++ from generating the warning for that specific block of code. The #pragma(push) preserves the existing state before #pragma warning(disable: 4789) changes it. The #pragma(pop) restores the pushed state, and removes the effects of the #pragma warning(disable:4789).

      To unpin an object on the managed heap pointed to by a pinning pointer declared in a block scope, the compiler simulates the behavior of destructors of local classes, "pretending" the pinning pointer has a destructor that nullifies the pointer.

      This warning indicates that a function that takes a buffer and a size is being passed a unchecked size. The data read-in from some external source has not been verified to see whether it is smaller than the buffer size.

    <description>
      This warning indicates that the specified function has been called in such a way that the resulting string might not be zero-terminated. This defect might cause an exploitable buffer overrun or crash. This warning is also generated if an annotated function expects a null terminated string is passed a string that is not null terminated.
      Most C standard library and Win32 string handling functions require and produce zero-terminated strings. A few 'counted string' functions (including strncpy, wcsncpy, _mbsncpy, _snprintf, and snwprintf) do not produce zero-terminated strings if they exactly fill their buffer. In this case, a subsequent call to a string function that expects a zero-terminated string will go beyond the end of the buffer looking for the zero. The program should make sure that the string ends with a zero. In general, you should pass a length to the 'counted string' function one smaller than the size of the buffer and then explicitly assign zero to the last character in the buffer.

      This warning indicates that a function that expects the number of characters is being passed the number of bytes instead. With wide (Unicode) characters, the values are different. This defect might cause an exploitable buffer overrun or crash.
      A common cause of this defect is using sizeof on a character array. The sizeof operator always computes the number of bytes; for ANSI characters this is the same as the number of characters, but for Unicode characters it is twice the number of characters.
      It is usually safe to compute the number of elements in an array by dividing the size of the array by the size of each element.

    <description>
      This warning indicates a mismatch between the format specifier and the function parameter. Even though the warning suggests using the address of the string, you must check the type of parameter a function expects before correcting the problem. For example, a %s specification for printf requires a string argument, but a %s specification in scanf requires an address of the string.

    <name>warning C6101: Returning uninitialized memory</name>
    <description>
      A successful path through the function does not set the named _Out_ parameter. This message is generated based on SAL annotations that indicate that the function in question always succeeds. A function that doesn’t return a success/failure indication should set all of its _Out_ parameters because the analyzer assumes that the _Out_ parameter is uninitialized data before the function is called, and that the function will set the parameter so that it’s no longer uninitialized. If the function does indicate success/failure, then the _Out_ parameter doesn't have to be set in the case of failure, and you can detect and avoid the uninitialized location. In either case, the objective is to avoid the reading of an uninitialized location. If the function sometimes doesn’t touch an _Out_ parameter that’s subsequently used, then the parameter should be initialized before the function call and be marked with the _Inout_ annotation, or the more explicit _Pre_null_ or _Pre_satisfies_() when appropriate. "Partial success" can be handled with the _When_ annotation. For more information, see Using SAL Annotations to Reduce C/C++ Code Defects.

    <description>
      This warning indicates that a function call is being made that could potentially lead to an overrun of a stack buffer, depending on the possible values of parameters to the function being analyzed. This defect might cause an exploitable buffer overrun or crash.
      It is a good idea to review the code, as well as the callers to this function, to see whether the function can ever be called with unexpected data. If it is not clear that all calls are safe, it might be appropriate to validate the input to the function by checking the length of any input strings or by annotating the function parameter using appropriate properties.

    <description>
      warning C6209: using 'sizeof&lt;variable1&gt;' as parameter &lt;number&gt; in call to &lt;function&gt; where &lt;variable2&gt; may be an array of wide characters, did you intend to use character count rather than byte count?
      This warning indicates that a parameter to a function call might incorrectly be a byte count instead of a character count. If this is the case, this defect is likely to cause a memory corruption or program crash, although some cases might cause an exploitable security hole.
      A common cause of this defect is using sizeof on a character array. The sizeof operator always computes the number of bytes. For ANSI characters this is the same as the number of characters; however, for Unicode characters it is twice the number of characters.
      It is usually safe to compute the number of elements in an array by dividing the size of the array by the size of each element.
      This warning is generated when:
      - A variable is passed as one parameter and sizeof that variable is passed as another parameter.
      - Both the variable type and the formal parameter type are some variety of pointer-to-wide char.

      This warning identifies a call that sets a SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR's DACL field to null. If the DACL that belongs to the security descriptor of an object is set to NULL, a null DACL is created. A null DACL grants full access to any user who requests it; normal security checking is not performed with respect to the object. A null DACL should not be confused with an empty DACL. An empty DACL is a properly allocated and initialized DACL that contains no ACEs. An empty DACL grants no access to the object it is assigned to.
      Objects that have null DACLs can have their security descriptors altered by malicious users so that no one has access to the object.
      Even if everyone needs access to an object, the object should be secured so that only administrators can alter its security. If only the creator needs access to an object, a DACL should not be set on the object; the system will choose an appropriate default.

    <description>
      This warning indicates that a call to VirtualFree without the MEM_RELEASE flag only decommits the pages, and does not release them. To decommit and release pages, use MEM_RELEASE flag in call to VirtualFree. If any pages in the region are committed, the function first decommits and then releases them. After this operation, the pages are in the free state. If you specify this flag, dwSize must be zero, and lpAddress must point to the base address returned by the VirtualAlloc function when the region was reserved. The function fails if either of these conditions is not met.
      You can ignore this warning if your code later frees the address space by calling VirtualFree with the MEM_RELEASE flag.
      For more information see VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree.
      The use of VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree have many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). These include shared_ptr, unique_ptr, and vector.

      There is some unintuitive behavior associated with sizeof operator. For example, in C, the sizeof ('\0') == 4, because a character is of an integral type. In C++, the type of a character literal is char, so sizeof ('\0') == 1.

The default stack frame size for this warning is 16 KB for user mode, 1 KB for kernel mode. Stack—even in user mode—is limited, and failure to commit a page of stack causes a stack overflow exception. Kernel mode has a 12 KB stack size limit, which cannot be increased; therefore, kernel-mode code should aggressively limit stack use.
      To correct the problem behind this warning, you can either move some data to the heap or to other dynamic memory. In user mode, one large stack frame may not be a problem—and this warning may be suppressed—but a large stack frame increases the risk of a stack overflow. (A large stack frame might occur if the function uses the stack heavily or is recursive.) The total stack size in user mode can be increased if stack overflow actually occurs, but only up to the system limit. You can use the /analyze command-line option to change the value for &lt;constant 2&gt;, but increasing it introduces a risk that an error will not be reported.
      For kernel-mode code—for example, in driver projects—the value of &lt;constant 2&gt; is set to 1 KB. Well-written drivers should have very few functions that approach this value, and changing the limit downward may be desirable. The same general techniques that are used for user-mode code to reduce the stack size can be adapted to kernel-mode code.

    <name>warning C6263: using _alloca in a loop; this can quickly overflow stack</name>
    <description>
      This warning indicates that calling _alloca inside a loop to allocate memory can cause stack overflow. _alloca allocates memory from the stack, but that memory is only freed when the calling function exits. Stack, even in user-mode, is limited, and failure to commit a page of stack causes a stack overflow exception. The _resetstkoflw function recovers from a stack overflow condition, allowing a program to continue instead of failing with a fatal exception error. If the _resetstkoflw function is not called, there is no guard page after the previous exception. The next time that there is a stack overflow, there are no exceptions at all and the process terminates without warning.
      You should avoid calling _alloca inside a loop if either the allocation size or the iteration count is unknown because it might cause stack overflow. In these cases, consider other options such as, heap memory, or Standard C++ Library Reference classes.

    <description>
      This warning indicates that a complex cast expression might involve a precedence problem when performing pointer arithmetic. Because casts group more closely than binary operators, the result might not be what the programmer intended. In some cases, this defect causes incorrect behavior or a program crash.
      In an expression such as:
      (char *)p + offset
      the offset is interpreted as an offset in characters; however, an expression such as:
      (int *)(char *)p + offset
      is equivalent to:
      ((int *)(char *)p) + offset
      and so the offset is interpreted as an offset in integers. In other words, it is equivalent to:
      (int *)((char *)p + (offset * sizeof(int)))
      which is not likely to be what the programmer intended.
      Depending on the relative sizes of the two types, this can lead to a buffer overrun.

    <description>
      This warning indicates that the result of a pointer dereference is being ignored, which raises the question of why the pointer is being dereferenced in the first place.
      The compiler will correctly optimize away the gratuitous dereference. In some cases, however, this defect may reflect a precedence or logic error.
      One common cause for this defect is an expression statement of the form: *p++;
      If the intent of this statement is simply to increment the pointer p, then dereference is unnecessary; however, if the intent is to increment the location that p is pointing to, then the program will not behave as intended because *p++ construct is interpreted as * (p++). instead of (*p)++.

    <description>
      This warning appears only in C++ code and indicates that the calling function has inconsistently allocated memory with the array new [] operator, but freed it with the scalar delete operator. This is undefined behavior according to the C++ standard and the Microsoft Visual C++ implementation. There are at least three reasons that this is likely to cause problems:
      - The constructors for the individual objects in the array are invoked, but the destructors are not invoked.
      - If global, or class-specific, operator new and operator delete are not compatible with operator new[] and operator delete[], unexpected results are likely to occur.
      - It is always very risky to rely on undefined behavior.
      The exact ramifications of this defect are difficult to predict. It might result in leaks for classes with destructors that perform memory de-allocation; inconsistent behavior for classes with destructors that perform some semantically significant operation; or memory corruptions and crashes when operators have been overridden. In other cases the mismatch might be unimportant, depending on the implementation of the compiler and its libraries. Analysis tool cannot always distinguish between these situations.
      If memory is allocated with array new [], it should be typically be freed with array delete[].

      The exact ramifications of this defect are difficult to predict. It might cause random behavior or crashes due to usage of uninitialized memory because constructors are not invoked. Or, it might cause memory allocations and crashes in situations where operators have been overridden. In rare cases, the mismatch might be unimportant. Analysis tool does not currently distinguish between these situations.

    <description>
      This warning indicates that the format string specifies a string, for example, a %s specification for printf or scanf, but a C++ object has been passed instead.
      This defect might produce incorrect output or crashes.
      This message is often reported due to passing a C++ object implementing some string type, for example, std::string, CComBSTR or bstr_t, into a C printf-style call. Depending on the implementation of the C++ class, that is, if the proper cast operators are defined, C++ string objects can often be used transparently whenever C strings are required; however, because parameters to printf-style functions are essentially untyped, no conversion to a string occurs.
      Depending on the object, it might be appropriate to insert a static_cast operator to the appropriate string type, for example, char * or TCHAR *, or to call a member function which returns a string, for example, c_str(), on instances of std::string.

      - The expression is mis-parenthesised:
      Because the result of ! is Boolean (zero or one), an attempt to test that two variables have bits in common will only end up testing that the lowest bit is present in the right side: ((!8) &amp; 1) == 0.

      The ! operator has a Boolean result, while the ~ operator has an arithmetic result. These operators are never interchangeable, even when operating on a Boolean value (zero or one): ((!0x01) &amp; 0x10) == 0x0, while ((~0x01) &amp; 0x10) == 0x10.
      - The binary operator &amp; is incorrect, and should instead be &amp;&amp;:

This cast will convert the stored 1 to a -1 and the comparison can yield unexpected results.

    <name>warning C6312: Possible infinite loop: use of the constant EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION in the exception-filter expression of a try-except</name>
    <description>
      This warning indicates the use of the constant EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION (or another constant that evaluates to -1) in the filter expression of a structured exception handler. Use of the constant value EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION could lead to an infinite loop. For example, if an exception was raised by hardware, the instruction that caused the exception will be restarted. If the address that caused the exception is still bad, another exception will occur and be handled in the same way. This causes an infinite loop.
      An explicit call to RaiseException will not directly cause an infinite loop, but it will continue execution of the code in the protected block. This can be unexpected, and could lead to an infinite loop if RaiseException was used to avoid dereferencing an invalid pointer.
      Typically, EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION should be returned only by a function called in the filter expression, which has a chance to fix either the pointer that caused the exception or the underlying memory.

    <description>
      For C runtime character-based routines in the family name isxxx(), passing an argument of type char can have unpredictable results. For example, an SBCS or MBCS single-byte character of type char with a value greater than 0x7F is a negative value. If a char is passed, the compiler might convert the value to a signed int or a signed long. This value could be sign-extended by the compiler, with unexpected results. For example, isspace accepts an argument of type int; however, the valid range of values for its input argument is:
      0 &lt;= c &lt;= 255, plus the special value EOF.

      Because the code analysis tool reports this warning when it cannot reduce a complex expression that represents the buffer size, or the index used to access the buffer, this warning might be reported in error.

      Warning C26135 is issued when the analyzer infers that a function is a lock wrapper function that has a lock acquire or lock release side effect. If the code is not intended to be a wrapper function, then either the lock is leaking (if the lock is being acquired) or it is being released incorrectly (if the lock is being released).

    <description>
      This warning is usually reported when an enum formal was not passed a member of the enum, but may also be used for other types.
      Because C permits enums to be used interchangeably, and interchangeably with constants, it is easy to pass the wrong enum value to a function without an error.
      For enum types, if the type of an enum parameter is annotated with _Enum_is_bitflag_, arithmetic is permitted on the parameter. Otherwise the parameter must be of exactly the correct type. If a constant is strictly required, warning C28137 may also apply.
      This rule can be used for other parameter types as well; see the function documentation for why the types must match exactly.

    <description>
      A function that is intended to acquire a resource before it exits has exited without acquiring the resource. This warning indicates that the function is annotated with __drv_acquiresResource but does not return having actually acquired the resource. If this function is a wrapper function, a path through the function did not reach the wrapped function. If the failure to reach the wrapped function is because the function returned an error and did not actually acquire the resource, you might need to use a conditional annotation (__drv_when).
      If this function actually implements the acquisition of the resource, it might not be possible for PFD to detect that the resource is acquired. In that case, use a #pragma warning to suppress the error. You can probably place the #pragma on the line preceding the { that begins the function body. The calling functions still need the annotation, but the Code Analysis tool will not be able to detect that the resource was acquired.

    <description>
      This warning is reported when a pointer to a pointer is used in a call to a function that is expecting a pointer to an object.
      The function takes a PVOID in this position. Usually, this indicates that &amp;pXXX was used when pXXX is required.
      Some polymorphic functions (functions that can evaluate to, and be applied to, values of different types) are implemented in C by using a PVOID argument that takes any pointer type. However, this allows the programmer to code a pointer to a pointer without causing a compiler error, even when this type is not appropriate.

      Additional information: &lt;pointer1&gt; contains the same NULL value as &lt;pointer2&gt; did &lt;note&gt;
      The code analysis tool reports this warning when it confirms that the pointer can be NULL. If there are unconfirmed instances where the error might occur earlier in the trace, the code analysis tool adds the line number of the first instance to the warning message so that you can change the code to address all instances.
      &lt;pointer2&gt; is confirmed to be potentially NULL. &lt;pointer1&gt; contains the same value as pointer2 and is being dereferenced. Because these pointers may be at very different places in the code, both are reported so that you can determine why the code analysis tool is reporting this warning.

    <description>
      This warning indicates that this value is unexpected in the current context. This warning usually appears when a NULL value is passed as an argument to a function that does not permit it. The value was actually found in the specified variable, and the argument is a copy of that variable.
      The Code Analysis tool reports this warning at the first point where it can definitively determine that the pointer is NULL or that it contains an illegal value. However, it is often the case that the error could actually occur earlier in the trace. When this happens, the Code Analysis tool will also give the line number of the first possible instance -- usually at a location where it could not definitively determine that the warning was appropriate. In those cases, the earlier location where this can occur is appended to the warning message. Typically, a code change should occur at or before that line number, rather than at the point of report.

    <name>warning C28193: The variable holds a value that must be examined</name>
    <description>
      This warning indicates that the calling function is not checking the value of the specified variable, which was supplied by a function. The returned value is annotated with the _Check_return_ annotation, but the calling function is either not using the value or is overwriting the value without examining it.
      This warning is similar to warning C6031, but it is reported only when the code does not test or examine the value of the variable, such as by using it in a comparison. Simply assigning the value is not considered to be a sufficient examination to avoid this warning. Aliasing the result out of the function is considered a sufficient examination, but the result itself should be annotated with _Check_return_.
      Certain functions (such as strlen) exist almost exclusively for their return value, so it makes sense for them to have the _Check_return_ annotation. For these functions, the Code Analysis tool might report this warning when the return value is unused. This usually indicates that the code is incorrect, for example, it might contain residual code that could be deleted. However, in some rare instances, the return value is intentionally not used. The most common of these instances is where a string length is returned but not actually used before some other test is made. That other test causes a path to be simulated where the string length ends up being unused. When this happens, the code can be correct, but it might be inefficient.
      There are two primary strategies for dealing with these cases where the return value is unused:
      Reorder the code so that the string length is only returned along the path where it is needed.
      Use a #pragma warning to suppress the warning--if by reordering the code, you would make the code too complex or otherwise less useful.

    <name>Warning C28197: Possibly leaking memory</name>
    <description>
      This warning is reported for both memory and resource leaks when the resource is potentially aliased to another location.
      The pointer points to allocated memory or to another allocated resource that was not explicitly freed. This warning is usually due to inadequate annotations on the called function, although inadequate annotations on the calling function can also make this more likely.
      This warning can be reported on function exit if an input argument has a __drv_freesMem or __drv_aliasesMem annotation. This warning typically indicates either a valid leak or that a function called by the current function needs additional annotation.
      In particular, the absence of the basic _In_ and _Out_ annotations make this warning fairly likely, although the __drv_aliasesMem and __drv_freesMem annotations might be needed as well. A false positive is a likely result of a missing _In_ annotation.
      Functions that take a pointer and alias it (thus avoiding a leak) should be annotated with __drv_aliasesMem. If you create a function that inserts an object into a global structure, or passes it to a system function that does that, you should add the __drv_aliasesMem annotation.
      Functions that free memory should be annotated with __drv_freesMem. The major functions that free memory already have this annotation.

    <description>
      Note: There are several prototypes for this function. This warning compares the first prototype with instance number &lt;number&gt;.
      If a declaration is made using a typedef, the line where the typedef appears is more useful than the line of the declaration.
      This warning refers to an error in the annotation and reflects the requirement that the annotations on a function declaration must match those on the definition, except if a function typedef is involved. In that case, the function typedef is taken as definitive for both the declaration and the definition.
      Note that annotations are usually implemented as macros, and one macro will usually yield several low-level annotations. This warning is reported for each unmatched low-level annotation, so a single unmatched annotation macro may yield a number of unmatched low-level annotations. It is best to simply compare the declaration and definition source code to make sure that they are the same. (Trivial differences in the order of the annotations are not reported.)
      The comparison is always between the first declaration found and the current one. If there are additional declarations, each declaration is checked pairwise. It is currently not possible to do a comparison other than in pairs, although it is possible to identify that there are more than two declarations/definitions. The text field above contains a list of the annotations that differ (at a fairly low level) between the two instances.
      This warning message displays the text of the underlying code sent to the compiler, and not the macros that are used to actually insert the annotation in the source code (as is the case whenever macros are used). In general, you do not need to understand the low-level annotations, but you should recognize that the annotations are being reported as inconsistent between the line numbers reported in the error message. Mostly, an inspection of the source code will make it clear why the inconsistency exists.

    <name>warning C28263: A syntax error in a conditional annotation was found for Intrinsic annotation</name>
    <description>
      The Code Analysis tool reports this warning when the return value for the specified function has a conditional value. This warning indicates an error in the annotations, not in the code being analyzed. If the function declaration is in a header file, the annotation should be corrected so that it matches the header file.
      The result list for the function and parameter specified has multiple unconditional values.
      Typically, this indicates that more than one unconditional _Null_ or __drv_valueIs annotations have been used to specify a result value.

    <name>Warning C28278: Function name appears with no prototype in scope.</name>
    <description>
      This warning typically indicates that a __deref is needed to apply the __return annotation to the value returned.
      The Code Analysis tool reports this warning when a function without a declaration was called, and the analysis that can be performed is limited because the declaration contains important information.
      The C language permits (but discourages) the use of a function for which no prototype has been declared. A function definition or a function declaration (prototype) should appear before the first use of the function. This warning indicates that a function without a declaration was called, and the analysis that can be performed is limited because declaration contains important information. If the function declaration were to contain annotations, the function declaration is even more useful to the Code Analysis tool.

      This warning is reported when an extra level of _Deref_ is used on a parameter.
      SAL2 does not require the use of an extra level of _Deref_ when dealing with reference parameters. This particular annotation is unambiguous and is interpreted correctly, but should be corrected.
      Frequently this can be corrected by simply removing the older __deref annotation and using SAL2 syntax. Sometimes may be necessary to use _At_ to reference the specific object to be annotated.

    <description>
      The format list argument position must be either a parameter name, or an integer offset that's in the parameter list, or zero.
      The second parameter to IsFormatString2 (where) can be in one of two forms:
      - A parameter name, which is taken as the first argument to the format string.
      - An offset (n) relative to the format-string parameter.
      In the second form, the first format-string parameter is the n-th argument after the format string. If n is zero, an ellipsis is specified as the parameter. Specifying an offset of zero without specifying the ellipsis as the first format-string parameter will cause an error.
